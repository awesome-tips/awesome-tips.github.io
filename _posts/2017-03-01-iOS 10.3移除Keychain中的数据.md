从`iOS 10.3`(目前还是beta版本)开始，保存在`keychain`中的App相关的数据，会随着应用的删除而被清除，重新安装App后将无法再从`keychain`中获取应用相关的数据。而10.3之前删除App并不会清理`keychain`中的对应数据。

如果希望App在重新安装后，仍然可以获取到之前的一些数据，则依赖于`keychain`的方案将变得不可靠。

不过，如果数据是在多个App间共享，则只有当所有相关的App都被删除后，才会删除`keychain`中的这些共享数据。

至于具体原由，可以参考[iOS 10.3 Beta 2 autodeletes keychain items after application uninstall?](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/72271)。

> This is an intentional change in iOS 10.3 to protect user privacy. Information that can identify a user should not be left on the device after the app that created it has been removed.

> It has never been a part of the API contract that keychain items created by an app would survive when the app is removed. This has always been an implementation detail.

> If a keychain item is shared with other apps, it won't be deleted until those other apps have been deleted as well.

> There is documentation in the works about this change that should address questions raised in this thread.
